go to the releases for an installer. if it doesnt work, plz contact me on discord at "HotChoco1132".


API may change every so often if one API goes down, meaning the UNC may change too.

This is only a easier GUI to navigate, (except there aint no tabs lol.).

Please note that this is still in development.



this is open source



To use Conductor, you first need to run the installer or unzip the ZIP file. they come in 2 different extensions sometimes.

After getting conductor, it wont run after doing the installer. you will need to search for conductor in your start menu or go to your desktop and click the shortcut there.

when opened, check the status. if it says "Roblox not opened", open roblox. Bloxstrap works too. ⚠SOME VERSIONS OF CONDUCTOR DONT HAVE A STATUS LABEL!⚠

after opening roblox, it should say "Conductor not injected". If it says that, dont inject it yet! You will need to join a game first.

after joining a game, you may now inject. since it uses a different api (atleast as i am writing this), it will say cloud injected or something on the client, and should also popup a notification saying "Sucsessfully
injected!". it should also change the status to injected. then you can get your script.

once you have your script, press Execute. this will run the code to the client.

Note, not all scripts work (as im writing this!).

stays open source for now.

You can keep windows defender on and there is no need for admin rights.


Windows desktop runtime 8 is required.

Open roblox from the EXE, not web.
